# gospeech

The gospeech repository is a port of gnuspeech from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnuspeech/ (C++) to Go

# versions

The V2 version is the one to use. The V1 version produces inferior sound and is in the respository for comparison only.

# general status

The port is complete and will properly produce speech from any word in the dictionary. Some of the functions in the C++ letter_to_sound directory have not been ported

# current status

12/20/2021 - Just tried the V2 version and though the waveform looks correct the file written is not readable as a wav file.
